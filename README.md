For our hackathon project, we decided to simulate a race between
5 cars for one lap. We created 5 spheres, and used texture mapping
to enable each car's logo to appear on the sphere. We also used
directional lighting and shading to make sure the spheres looked 
three dimensional, and that the logos were visible. The cars in our 
race are a BMW, Tesla, Porsche, Mercedes Benz, and a Maserati. 

Our racing data came from Nurburgring, which is a motorsports complex
that holds a Grand Prix racetrack. With lots of lap time data easily
available for all our cars, we used it the information to make sure
our spheres moved proportionally to the cars' speeds in real life.
We also added functionality to make sure that when a car finishes the
simulated race, a statement prints out to the screen telling the user
which car won, and what rank it came in.
